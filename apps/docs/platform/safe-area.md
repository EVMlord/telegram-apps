# Safe Area

The **safe area** ensures your app's content on mobile screens is fully visible and usable 
by preventing it from being obscured by device features like notches or bottom dock (navigation bars) and Telegram UI features like buttons in [full screen mode](full-screen.md).  

In TMA there are 2 different Safe Area objects:
- Safe Area Inset
- Content Safe Area Inset

## Safe Area Inset

This Safe Area represents paddings from **Device UI** like notches, bottom dock (navigation bars) and other possible **System UI** elements.
